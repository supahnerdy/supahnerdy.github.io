# CYB-3353: Arch Linux Installation (MacOS)
Welcome to the Arch Linux Installation Documentation! This guide will go through the steps to install Arch based on the wiki instructions, as well as a few modifications that can be tweaked as desired. 

Arch Linux is a distribution that is structured by its five prinicples of simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user-centrality, and versatility. Any configurations are completely to the user's discretion.


NOTE: The hardware used for this installation is **VMware Fusion 12** running on a **MacOS 12.5.** 

# Installation Guide
It is recommended that you read through and follow the installation guide on the official wiki [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide). Regardless, this section will narrow it down to what's really important for brevity and clarity.


## 1. First Steps
NOTE: These initial steps will look different if you are running different hardware (such as VMware Workstation on Windows), but the configuration is all the same.
1. Download the Arch **.iso** file (x86_64) from any [mirror](https://archlinux.org/download/).
2. Click the **+** sign in the top left of VMWare Fusion, and select **Newâ€¦**
3. **Drag** the .iso file into the box
### Installation Wizard
1. Select the OS: **Linux --> Other Linux 5.x kernel 64-bit**
2. Specify the boot firmware: **UEFI** (leave secure boot unchecked)
### Customize Settings
1. Processors: **2 processor cores** (do not overprovision)
2. Memory: **2048MB** (if low RAM: at least **1024MB** to reduce issues)
3. Internet sharing: **Share with my Mac** (we are using NAT)
4. Disk size: **20GB** (we'll allocate more than enough)
5. Bus type: **SCSI**
6. **UNCHECK** pre-allocate disk space (avoid storage issues!)

Boot up your newly created virtual machine. Select the **Arch Linux install medium** and press Enter.
